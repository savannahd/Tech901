                    <p>	    Hi! I am Savannah, a Pilates instructor from Memphis, Tennessee. My superpower is making really great old people. It brings me great joy to help my clients build strong cores, flexible backs, and better proprioception. In a world where sitting has become a significant part of our lives. Pilates is needed now more than ever. Through Pilates, I have the privilege  of teaching my clients functional movement allowing them to age gracefully and pain free.</p>
                    <p>     As much as I love teaching Pilates, it can be physically demanding. It is not possible to teach 40 hours a week. I have been thinking about taking a course from Tech901 for years now. Covid-19 and the fitness industryâ€™s shift to virtual training gave me the push I needed. I am hoping Tech901 will give me the skills to add a supplemental income to my Pilates practice, and help me stay on top of the new virtual fitness industry.</p>
