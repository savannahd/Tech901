                    <p>Fiddle leaf figs, or ficus lyrata, love to be fed! Their large leaves and relatively fast growth demand plenty of nutrition. But how often should you fertilize? The rate that you should fertilize your fiddle leaf fig depends on the season you’re in, how fast you want your plant to grow, and the type of fertilizer you are using.</p>
                    <br><p>Plants often suffer because of under-fertilization, which leads to slow growth and yellowing leaves. Proper fertilization will give your plant the best health and keep it deep green and gorgeous. Let’s expand more on each of these factors now.</p>
                    <br><p>But before we start, keep in mind that as pre-requisite for growth, you must keep your plant in ideal growing conditions light and water-wise. An unhealthy plant that’s fighting for its life, that’s overwatered or dried-out, is not going to grow, no matter how much fertilizer you add.

                    <h5><p>Houseplants are most active during the spring and summer because of the abundance of light. Fertilization is most important during these times. Your fiddle leaf plant is begging for nutrients and cannot grow and prosper without them.</p></h5>
                <li>FERTILIZING FICUS LYRATA FOR GROWTH</li>
                    <h5><p>All fiddle leaf fig plants need nutrients, whether they are actively growing or not. But those that are growing a lot will deplete their soil of nutrients more quickly. Your fertilizing schedule depends on how fast you’d like your plant to grow.</p>
                    <br><p>If you have a young plant that you’d like to grow quickly, you can fertilize with our custom-formulated Fiddle Leaf Fig Plant Food each and every time you water. This ensures that your plant gets a gentle but steady supply of the nutrition it needs. Fiddle leaf figs can grow 12 to 18 inches each year when fed properly and given an abundance of natural light!</p></h5>

                <h5><p>Understanding a bit about what happens inside the potting mix of your houseplant can help you care for it better. As always, I’m going to be using simple terms to explain the concepts, so you don’t need to have an MA in horticultural science. The web of roots of the plant constitutes its main feeding organ, where it receives all the nutrients it needs to live and grow properly.</p></h5>
